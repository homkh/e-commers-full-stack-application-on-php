      <p align="justify"> Agricultural product65ity depends on the farmland quality, and a soil test can timely report a problem in crop growth conditions. Field suitability analysis helps choose the appropriate crops or decide on land use for farming.</br>
      Regular soil testing is ultimately important not only for growers but can provide valuable field insights to all agribusiness players, including agri-coops, crop insurers, banks, input suppliers, or commodity traders. Nonetheless, designated laboratories describe only the current field properties. So, while analyzing soil test results for decisions on field amelioration, it’s better to combine lab reports with historical data from satellite imagery analytics.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container mt-4">
    <div class="container">
      <h4>What Is Soil Testing?</h4>
      <p>It is the farmland analysis for multiple parameters like chemical content, toxicity, pH level, salinity, earth-dwelling biota, etc. Such tests also provide information on chemical contamination, humic or organic content, electric conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and other physical and chemical properties.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>The analysis type depends on the explored components or properties of the field ground that may beneficially or adversely impact crop development. The most frequently-used types analyze and measure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>mineral content,</li>
        <li>pH level,</li>
        <li>soil moisture,</li>
        <li>salinity,</li>
        <li>pesticides and chemical contamination,</li>
        <li>structure and texture, etc.</li>
      </ul>  
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-3">

    </div>
    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>Soil Nutrient Testing</h4>
      <p>Valuable information on nutrients content allows accurate fertilization to support plant needs within precision agriculture implementations. This is why the chemical test for soil nutrients is the most common.
      <br>
      Primarily, soil tests report on the content of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which are the most important nutrients for crops. Secondary nutrients to examine are calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and magnesium (Mg). An extended test also includes minor elements like iron (Fe), manganese (Mg), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), and others.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>Soil Acidity Test (pH)</h4>
      <p>Proper pH in the field is essential for plant productivity, and either too high or too low pH will adversely affect crop growth. Testing pH of soil, one calculates its hydrogen ions. pH values may range from 0 to 14. The neutral value is 7, lower levels are for acidity, and higher than 7 mean alkalinities. Acidic or alkaline fields are treated correspondingly. For example, pH can be raised with lime, and an accurate pH test helps determine its required quantity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>Soil Salinity Test</h4>
        <p>In saline fields, plants suffer from osmotic stresses due to poor water absorption. Soil salinity testing helps understand the suitability of lands for agricultural activities. Field salinity can be analyzed through:
        <li>evaporation of total soluble salts (TSS) from the ground-water extract.</li>
        <li>measuring the electric conductivity (EC) of a saturated paste extract or a distilled water-earth dilution.</li>  
.     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>Testing Soil For Pesticides and Contaminations</h4>
      <p>Pesticides help control any non-beneficial organisms that destroy crops. Chemicals effectively suppress weeds, manage crop diseases, or combat pests. At the same time, such substances poison non-target organisms and pollute nature. Highly aggressive substances leach into groundwater, remain in the land for many years, and harm humans and animals, accumulating in food.<br>Chemical contaminants reduce the yield quality, so it is important to conduct testing soil for pesticides before seeding and plan subsequent crop treatment based on past field activities and productivity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>Physical Soil Testing For Texture And Structure</h4>
      <p>Apart from the chemical content, agricultural soil testing also analyzes the soil type and its physical properties like texture, structure, and moisture.<br>

      The main components are clay, sand, and silt, and their proportions define the ground texture and its ability to retain nutrients with moisture. For example, sandy fields dry faster than clay ones, so a soil texture test helps in precision irrigation and fertigation planning.<br>

      Soil structure describes the size of its parts and pore spaces, which affect the flow of water and air in the earth. Clay fields are finer, and their pore spaces are small. Therefore, they are prone to compaction and require regular aeration.</p>
    <div>

    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>How To Get The Soil Tested?</h4>
      <p>Deciding on how to conduct a soil test, you can choose any options:<br>
        1.Do it yourself with special kits.<br>
        2.Send samples for a professional analysis to a state or private laboratory. Soil test procedures in some local labs are free.<br>
        3.Hire a company that will cover the whole process from sampling to field amelioration recommendations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>How To Take Soil Samples For Testing</h4>
      <p>Farmland analysis provides necessary information for correct field treatment, but the precision of the results depends on accurate sampling. The basic soil sampling methods are based on grids and zones.</p>
      <img src="https://eos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/how-to-take-soil-sampling.jpg.webp" style="max-width: 100%;">
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>Grid Sampling</h4>
      <p>This method is based on equally spaced grids, usually one to five acres. The smaller the grid, the more accurate the result is. The larger the grid, the more subsamples are needed. For example, a one-acre grid cell requires a minimum of five subsamples, while up to ten subsamples should be collected for grids of five acres. Grid soil sampling provides spatial information on the field, but it doesn’t consider ground variability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>Zone Soil Sampling</h4>
      <p>This method suggests taking average samples from each field zone. The field is divided into zones based on crop maps or the soil type. Each zone has similar conditions, so the zones’ number and sizes depend on their variability. Usually, the sizes range from two to ten acres. The larger the zone, the more soil test probes are required (at least five subsamples for each zone, two subsamples per acre).<br>

      Agronomic soil testing gives detailed information on field health, but several data sources can provide even better insights. This is where the Zoning feature on EOSDA Crop Monitoring is particularly useful. Satellite-based productivity maps on the platform show field variability through vegetation indices, helping more accurately outline different zones for sampling. Such a combination assists in making decisions on necessary chemical inputs depending not only on the vegetation state but specific properties of each zone.</p>
    </div>  
    <div class="container mt-3">
      <h4>How To Read A Soil Test?</h4>
      <p>A laboratory report usually includes the results on the specified parameters and the volumes of chemical elements in the samples. It is important to know nutrient norms and correspondingly adjust their concentrations.<br>
      For example, the required nitrogen concentrations depend on the soil type and are the highest for clay fields:
      <li>sandy earths (25 – 50 mg-N/kg).</li>
      <li>loam earths (50 – 75 mg-N/kg).</li>
      <li>clay earths (75 – 125 mg-N/kg).</li></p>

        Apart from nutrient content, a soil test report may include the following parameters:
        <li>Class indicates humic matter content and falls into three types: mineral, mineral-organic, and organic. Mineral-rich fields (MIN) have low humic concentrations, while organic ones (ORG) are the richest in humus. In mineral-organic fields, (M-O), humic content is medium.</li>
        <li>Organic matter (OM) shows organic matter content in the samples. Except for sandy grounds, organic matter norms for row crops are 2.5% or higher.</li>
        <li>Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) measures the ability of the field ground to retain cations (positively charged ions). The average values are 13-25 CEC but can vary from 1 to 40.</li>

        Farm soil test results from a laboratory may include amelioration recommendations to increase yields, for example, fertilizer adjustments or lime applications to reduce acidity. However, a laboratory report provides information only on the current state of things in the field. For this reason, it is also important to consider the following historical data of field conditions while understanding soil test results for nutrient supplies:
        <li>crop types and crop rotation</li>
        <li>tillage depth for conventional tillage</li>
        <li>conservation tillage or no-till practices</li>
        <li>soil type</li>
        <li>fertilization or fertigation events.</li>
        The process of interpreting soil test results won’t be complete without these aspects because each of them makes a certain impact on the field.
